# Topic 1: Conditional Statements 
# Program 1: Smart Canteen Discount System
# Topic: if, elif, else, comparison operators, and logical thinking.
# Real-World Scenario
# Imagine a college canteen where students receive discounts based 
# on their total bill.

# The canteen follows these rules:
# - If the bill is Rs. 3,000 or more, the student receives a 
# 20% discount.
# - If the bill is Rs. 2,000 or more but less than Rs. 3,000, 
# the student receives a 10% discount.
# - If the bill is Rs. 1,000 or more but less than Rs. 2,000, 
# the student receives a 5% discount.
# - If the bill is less than Rs. 1,000, no discount is provided.
# - The program must display the original bill, discount amount,
# and final payable amount.

print("===== SMART CANTEEN =====")
bill_amount = float(input("Enter your total bill amount (Rs.): "))

if bill_amount >= 3000:
    discount_rate = 20
elif bill_amount >= 2000:
    discount_rate = 10
elif bill_amount >= 1000:
    discount_rate = 5
else:
    discount_rate = 0
discount_amount = bill_amount * discount_rate / 100
final_amount = bill_amount - discount_amount

print("\n===== BILL SUMMARY =====")
print(f"Original Bill: Rs. {bill_amount:.2f}")
print(f"Discount Rate: {discount_rate}%")
print(f"Discount Amount: Rs. {discount_amount:.2f}")
print(f"Final Payable: Rs. {final_amount:.2f}")



# Practice Question:
# Student Challenge
# Ask students to extend the program with these features:
# 1. If the bill is less than or equal to zero, display an invalid 
# bill message.
# 2. If the student has a membership card, provide an additional 5% 
# discount.
# 3. Display a message saying "Congratulations! You saved Rs. X" 
# when a discount is applied.
# Teaching question: Why do we use elif instead of writing several 
# independent if statements?
